# Issue Summary

### Duration of the Outage:
The outage occurred from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM Pacific Time.

### Impact:
The website became completely unresponsive due to a crash in the backend API service. Users were unable to interact with any part of the application during this time.

### Root Cause:
A recent deployment introduced a bug in the API's error-handling mechanism. The bug led to an unhandled exception that caused the API service to crash when certain conditions were met. This issue was not caught earlier due to insufficient test coverage and the absence of proper error-checking in the code.

## Timeline

- **3:00 PM**: Users began reporting that the website wasn't loading. Monitoring systems detected a sharp increase in errors, indicating that the backend API was down.
- **3:10 PM**: The issue was escalated to the development team. Logs pointed to a crash in the API service, but the exact cause was unclear.
- **3:20 PM**: The team initiated a rollback of the recent deployment, suspecting it might be the root cause. The rollback completed quickly, but the site remained down.
- **3:30 PM**: Deeper investigation revealed that the error-handling code in the API had a missing condition, leading to an unhandled exception under specific circumstances.
- **4:00 PM**: The development team identified the exact line of code responsible and began working on a hotfix.
- **4:20 PM**: The hotfix was deployed, and the API service was restarted. 
- **4:30 PM**: The site was back online, and full functionality was restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution

### Root Cause:
The root cause was a missing error-checking condition in the backend API code, introduced during the latest deployment. This omission led to an unhandled exception, causing the service to crash and resulting in the outage.

### Resolution:
The team fixed the issue by adding the missing error-checking condition. A hotfix was developed and deployed to production, and the API service was restarted to bring the site back online.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements:
- **Increase Test Coverage**: Expand unit tests and integration tests to cover edge cases and error scenarios that were previously missed.
- **Code Review Enhancements**: Tighten the code review process, focusing specifically on error handling and exception management.
- **Staging Environment Improvements**: Enhance the staging environment to more accurately reflect production, to catch issues before they go live.

### Task List:
- Write new tests to cover edge cases in the API.
- Review and refactor error-handling practices across the codebase.
- Implement post-deployment monitoring scripts that automatically revert changes if error rates exceed a certain threshold.

## Example Code Snippet

Below is the code snippet that was part of the hotfix, which ensures proper error handling:

```javascript
try {
  // Execute a critical operation that might fail
  const result = performCriticalOperation();
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error gracefully
  console.error('Critical operation failed:', error.message);
  // Execute recovery logic or return a safe response
  return fallbackResponse();
}
